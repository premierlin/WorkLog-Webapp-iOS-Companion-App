# WorkLog-Webapp-iOS-Companion-App
J1 H2 CP Project, Webapp for the school. The webapp is built with flask and the iOS companion app is built with Apple's new declarative language, SwiftUI. 

<h3>Flask Homework Logger</h3>
Flask app that runs off python with templates running with HTML and CSS. Clean and simple website for navigation sake. Can be used on PythonAnywhere as well as Replit. 

<h3>Homework Folder</h3>
iOS app meant for receiving data from JSON file, companion app to Flask Webapp. <b>Installation to iOS device is close to impossible currently for non-programmers.</b> Installation instructions as follows (will require macbook or virtual machine running macOS Catalina). 


  1. Install latest Xcode version. 
  2. Download folder from Github and open xcode project.
  3. Change details of signing capabilities accordingly (email and apple ID).
  4. Connect phone and install using play button at the top left hand corner. 
  5. App will only stay on phone for a max of 7 days due to Apple's limitation for free developer certificate. 
  
The app will only run on iOS devices with iOS 13 and above as it is written in SwiftUI which only supports newer devices. 

There is currently no IPA file for the app. Plans for Android app coming soon.
